\section{Contributing}
% ===================================================================================

Documentation is one of those things that gets easily neglected in open source projects.  It is also one of the easiest for outsiders to contribute to.  The documentation is managed as \LaTeX, which may scare some people.  But no worries, those who don't want to learn \LaTeX don't have to.

There are broadly two ways for contributing to the documentation:

\begin{description}
  \item[File a bug.]  Visit the \href{https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?assigned_to=&blocked=&bug_severity=normal&bug_status=NEW&comment=&contenttypeentry=&contenttypemethod=autodetect&data=&dependson=&description=&flag_type-1=X&flag_type-11=X&flag_type-12=X&flag_type-2=X&flag_type-4=X&flag_type-6=X&flag_type-7=X&flag_type-8=X&form_name=enter_bug&keywords=&&op_sys=All&product=MDT.RMF&qa_contact=&rep_platform=All&short_desc=&version=unspecified}{RMF Bug Tracker}.  You can just point out a problem or request for improvement.  You can also provide some text to be added to the documentation (unformatted).  If you do, however, then you need to sign a Committer License Agreement (CLA)
  \item[Submit improved \LaTeX via Gerrit.]  If you are technically inclined (meaning that you know what \LaTeX and git are, and how to use them), then you can contribute via the Gerrit code review system, as described \href{https://wiki.eclipse.org/Gerrit}{at eclipse.org}.
