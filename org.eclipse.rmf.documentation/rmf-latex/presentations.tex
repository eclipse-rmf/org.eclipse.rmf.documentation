ProR has an extension mechanism that allows custom rendering for certain
attributes of a SpecObject. The following Presentations have been
implemented:

\section{ID Generator Presentation}

This presentation allows the designation of Attributes to be used as
human-readable IDs. The user defines a prefix, and the presentation
manages a counter. When a new SpecObject with a designated Attribute is
created, then it will get an ID, consisting of prefix and number.

TODO: The plugin doesn't check whether an ID already exists - it simply
takes the next number and increments the counter. We should (1) Set the
counter correctly upon opening a ReqIF and (2) hook in a Validator.

\section{Linewrap Presentation}

This presentation automatically renders long text with linebreaks and
allows editing with linebreaks.

\section{Headline Presentation}

This presentation renders an attribute in bigger font and bold. It
allows setting the font size.
