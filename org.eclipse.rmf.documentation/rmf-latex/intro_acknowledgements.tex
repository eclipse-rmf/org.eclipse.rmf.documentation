Many parties were involved in the creation of RMF.  We would like to thank the core team that made it possible.

The roots of this project were created by Andreas Graf, Michael Jastram and Nirmal Sasidharan, who joined together individual projects to create RMF.  Their efforts were financed by the research projects itea Verde and FP7 Deploy.  RMF was assembled at the Eclipse Foundation, where it has been active ever since.  Figure~\ref{fig:intro_core_team} shows four of the five RMF Committers at a joint coding session (missing is Andreas Graf).
