Many parties were involved in creating RMF we would like to thank the core team that made it possible.

The roots of this project were created by Andreas Graf, Michael Jastram and Nirmal Sasidharan, who joined their various projects together.  Their efforts were financed by the research projects itea Verde and FP7 Deploy.  Together, they brought the project to the Eclipse Foundation, where it has been an active project ever since.  Figure~\ref{fig:intro_core_team} shows four of the five RMF Committers at a joint coding session (missing is Andreas Graf).
